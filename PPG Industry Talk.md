### Summary

From the industry talk I attended, I learned several important points. First, communication within our team is very important because it helps us share ideas, discuss opinions, and work together more effectively. Second, soft skills, like being able to use various tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, and others, are essential to improve our performance and quality of work. Finally, we must never stop learning and improving ourselves because competition in the industry is becoming stronger every day. Attending talks like this reminds me how important it is to stay updated, develop both technical and soft skills, and work well with others.

### Reflection
 One of the valuable information I gained from the talk is PPG focuses  heavily  on
 innovation, sustainabilty and product quality.Besides that,they also share some tips
 on how to stand out in the Job Market.Among them are building projects that use real
 world datasets (open data sources) and  stay curious,which means   keep learning new
 tools and keeping up with the trends

 ### Suggestion for improvement
- Have a more stable connection to ensure students get the information clearly
- Share the slide with students,not compulsory to share the whole slide,only the main point of the talk
- Create a simple quiz session such as Kahoot to make sure the students are engaged
