### Summary

From the industry talk I attended, I learned several important points. First, communication within our team is very important because it helps us share ideas, discuss opinions, and work together more effectively. Second, soft skills, like being able to use various tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, and others, are essential to improve our performance and quality of work. Finally, we must never stop learning and improving ourselves because competition in the industry is becoming stronger every day. Attending talks like this reminds me how important it is to stay updated, develop both technical and soft skills, and work well with others.
