### Reflection

This lab helped me understand the main components of a PC and their functions.<br>
I learned the correct steps to disassemble and assemble a computer safely.There are<br> 
some sensitive components such as the motherboard,RAM, CPU, power supply, and storage<br>
devicesrequired careful handling to prevent hardware damage. The activity improved my<br>
teamwork skills and increased my confidence in handling hardware.<br>

### Suggestion for improvement
- Provide more PCs so that a group only has a maximum of four students.
  This helps students get more tasks and space to understand the procedures better.
