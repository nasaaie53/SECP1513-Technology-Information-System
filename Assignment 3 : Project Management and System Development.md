- The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several interconnected phases that provide a structured framework for developing a system. These phases        include Planning, Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Implementation, and Maintenance. Each phase plays a vital role in ensuring the system is successfully     developed, with System Design being especially critical in shaping the final product
- Each phase in SDLC plays an important role and related to each other
- The design phase is the most important phase because the decision is made from here.This phase will affect the quality,efficiency and the system success
- Reduce the dependence on Artificial Intelligence.AI may help us to improve the efficiency,time spent,creativity and solve complex problems.
- The down side of AI can affect our life in terms of problem solving, creativity, and crictical thinking skills.

### Reflection

Attending industry talks made me realize that an IT career is not just about coding, but also about project and system management skills. I also understood that successful projects go through the SDLC phase and that AI is increasingly taking over routine tasks, so the role of my skills needs to be expanded and enhanced to keep up. These talks motivated me to learn early, master both technical and management skills, and ensure that the systems I build are secure and reliable

### Suggestion for Improvements

- Provide a simple example of a project that show the flow of SDLC methodes
- Ask more quetions to students related to real life project to improve their level of thinking
