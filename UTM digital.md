### Reflection

This visit to UTM Digital was very helpful and beneficial because it showed us how technology is applied in real life. It gave us a clearer understanding of how digital systems are used to support daily operations in an organization. Besides that, it helped us connect what we learned in class with how it is applied in actual organizations, making the learning process more meaningful.
Through this visit, we were also exposed to the real role of managing data and digital services. We learned how these services help improve efficiency, communication, and decision-making within the organization. Overall, this visit increased our awareness of the importance of technology in today’s working environment and helped us better understand how our studies are related to future careers.
