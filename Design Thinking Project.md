## Summary
This project is aims to improve the energy effiency on Campus.We will develop a smart campus data solution based on the data to enhance the student experience at UTM.We go through five phase consist of **Empathize**,**Define**,**Ideate**,**Prototype**,and **Test** to identify the main issue and develop a creative prototype.Plus,we also need to create a video around 4-5 minutes and a Pecha Kucha presentation session.Overall,all group work processes and evidence of every phase are recorded in order to write a reflection of innovation learning and problem solving skills.

## Reflection
This Design Thinking project has open my perspective on how the technology can help a lot to solve any kind of problem.It taught me to think crictically and collaboratively in the Ideate and Prototype.Those skills are very important to me as my goal for developing products that truly meet market needs in the future.Overall,this project had strenghten my communication skiils and team working directly or indirectly.I also will always update the process of every upcoming project as it helps a lot in journey

## Suggestion for improvement
- Provide harder theme in order to maximize the crictical thinking skills
- Provide longer time to complete the project but need to update the process on GitHub to prevent last minute working
