  One important aspect that we must always maintain is good manners towards our lecturers. No matter how knowledgeable we are, we should always show respect to them. Ethics also play an important role in our          The better a person’s ethics, the easier it is for others to respect and work well with them.

- What I learned from the second topic, which is how to write a perfect resume, is that companies usually look for resumes that are complete and detailed, especially in terms of educational background and soft        skills. Companies also tend to reject resumes that use Canva templates because these templates often contain too much decoration and unnecessary information that companies do not need.
  Therefore, the team helps fresh graduates create a clean, well-structured, and professional resume so that it is easier for them to be recruited by companies.
