## Asean Quantum Summit 2025

### 11 December 2025 at Dewan Sultan Iskandar,UTM Johor Bahru

---
### Introduction 
- This event aims to introduce and dedicated advancement in quantum technologies.In order to share the journey into a new technological paradigm.All the researchers,scientist and industry leaders from across Asean and Japan are invited

---
### Contents
- Fields such quantum computer,quantum communication and quantum sensor.These kind of fields are the foundation of technologies that need to be discuss for the bright future of scientific and industry
- Qubit,which is the most basis of Quantum Computer.Qubit is likely to normal bit in computer,but has an abilty to superposition.One of the advantages is can solve complex calculation faster than a normal computer.
- Quantum technology exhibition and opportunities for companies and researchers to showcase their work, as well as MoUs (official collaborations) between universities and companies from ASEAN and Japan

### Reflection
- This event absolutely give me a clear understanding of Quantum Computer,especially at  the Qubit part.I was amazed after knowing the real potential of Quantum technologies in solving complex problems that even a normal computer not able to solve it.Besides,I am hoping to delve-into more theory or hands-on experience regarding this Quatum fields.I truly appreciated the coorperation between the researchers,industry and goverment in develope the ecosystem of Quantum in Asean for having us as participants to such a meaningful event.I am looking forward to attends next Quantum event if I stand a chance.All in all,I want to thank UTM and all the organisers involved

### Suggestion for improvements
