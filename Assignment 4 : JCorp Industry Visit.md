Moreover,he also shared about the digital strategy which focuses on the use of AI, Automation, and Analytics technologies to empower the three main elements of the organization, namely People, Process, and Innovation. Through the integration of these technologies, the organization aims to continuously increase business value towards becoming a more efficient, synergistic, and productive Exponential Organization (ExO). Overall, this technology is the backbone in ensuring every workflow runs more smoothly and systematically.

### Reflection

As a data engineering student who has seen this strategy firsthand in the industry, I realize that digital transformation is not just about software sophistication, but how technology acts as a catalyst to humanize work processes. Furthermore, I see that technical skills need to go hand in hand with the ability to adapt to the digital ecosystem. Integrating AI and Analytics is no longer an option but a necessity to ensure organizations remain relevant, where every decision must be data-driven to minimize risk and maximize impact on society.

### Suggestion for improvement
- Provide more time while exploring each room in the office and open and open a Q&A session to ensure everyone engaged
